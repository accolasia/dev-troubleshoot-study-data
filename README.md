# Developer Troubleshooting Study Data
This repository contains shared research data from a study at University of Victoria on developer troubleshooting experiences.

## Contents of the Repository

The developer troubleshooting study included 27 semi-structured interviews of software developers about their troubleshooting experiences.  We used a Constructivist Grounded Theory (CGT) process to conduct grounded coding by reviewing the interview transcripts line by line and interpreting what is happening in the developer's experience.  This repository includes grounded coding data from the first 12 interviews when we reached theoretical saturation.  

We include 16 reports, each report represents a research question and the grounded codes related to the area of inquiry. The research questions for the reports are also listed below. Within the reports we retain the links to which participant the grounded code originated, to make it clear when similar grounded codes are from the same or from multiple participants.  The grounded coding data was then imported into miro and sorted into clusters for further analysis and theoretical development.  We provide links to the miro boards for each research question below as well.

## Research Questions

*Developer Context Questions:*

* What kind of role is the developer currently working in?
* What type of development environments are developers working in? Are they more sophisticated/mature with infrastructure automation, or more legacy?
* What type of company environment is the developer working in? Is it a startup or big corporate? Whatâ€™s the company and team culture like?
* What is the organizational/team structure that the developer works in? Who does the developer collaborate with?
* How do developers identify themselves?

*Troubleshooting Questions:*

* What are the different types of troubleshooting situations people see?
* What are the different steps/stages/subprocesses involved in the troubleshooting process?
* What are the different strategies developers use to troubleshoot?
* What makes troubleshooting easy vs difficult?
* How do developers feel while they are troubleshooting? How do their feelings change before and after? What factors influence how they feel?
* How do developers learn how to troubleshoot? (emergent)

*Asking for Help Questions:*

* How do developers reach out for help? Who do they decide to ask and why?
* Does the developer lean toward collaborating or anti-ask for help? What do these different cultural norms look like around collaboration?
* Why do developers decide not to ask for help?
* How do developers collaborate and try to help one another? What does the process look like? What are the strategies developers use to collaborate?
* Is collaborating effective? What makes it effective?
